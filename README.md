# Port_PITFALL
This project is based on the portability of the game PITFALL! Originally designed for the ATARI 2600 video game and
new versions of the Windows operating system.
This project has been developed since September for the technology
week (SEMATEC) at Fatec and Araçatuba, which, through this event, makes university-community integration possible
and promotes the subjects taught at the unit.
